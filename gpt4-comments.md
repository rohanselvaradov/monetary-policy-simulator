## Question 1
The components of the closed economy AS-AD model are:
- IS: $\tilde Y_t = \bar a - \bar b(R_t - \bar r)$
- MPR: $R_t - \bar r = \psi (\pi_t - \bar \pi) + \phi \tilde Y_t$
- PC: $\pi_t = \pi_{t-1} + \bar \nu \tilde Y_t + \bar o_t$

How do I approach using a computer program to numerically calculate the evolution of the unknowns $\tilde Y_t$ and $pi_t
$ over time, given initial conditions and shocks over time?

## Answer 1
To numerically calculate the evolution of the unknowns $\tilde Y_t$ (output gap) and $\pi_t$ (inflation) over time using the closed economy AS-AD model components you've provided, you can follow a systematic approach. Here, I'll outline a method using a step-by-step approach, suitable for implementation in many programming languages like Python, MATLAB, or R. The model components you provided are:

1. **IS Curve**: $\tilde Y_t = \bar a - \bar b(R_t - \bar r)$
2. **Monetary Policy Rule (MPR)**: $R_t - \bar r = \psi (\pi_t - \bar \pi) + \phi \tilde Y_t$
3. **Phillips Curve (PC)**: $\pi_t = \pi_{t-1} + \bar \nu \tilde Y_t + \bar o_t$

Where:
- $\tilde Y_t$ is the output gap at time $t$,
- $R_t$ is the nominal interest rate at time $t$,
- $\pi_t$ is the inflation rate at time $t$,
- $\bar a$, $\bar b$, $\bar r$, $\psi$, $\phi$, $\bar \pi$, $\bar \nu$, and $\bar o_t$ are parameters (with bars indicating they are constants or targets),
- $\bar o_t$ represents shocks to inflation.

To numerically simulate this model, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define Initial Conditions and Parameters
You need to set initial values for $\tilde Y_{t-1}$, $\pi_{t-1}$, and any shocks ($\bar o_t$) you expect over time. Also, define your model's parameters ($\bar a$, $\bar b$, $\bar r$, $\psi$, $\phi$, $\bar \pi$, $\bar \nu$, and any specific $\bar o_t$ for shocks).

### Step 2: Create a Time Array
Decide on the number of periods ($T$) you want to simulate and create a time array (e.g., 0 to $T$).

### Step 3: Initialize Arrays for Unknowns
Create arrays or lists to store the values of $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ over time, with their initial values set based on your initial conditions.

### Step 4: Iterative Calculation
For each time step $t$ from 1 to $T$, perform the following calculations iteratively:

- **Solve for $R_t$ using the MPR**:
  Given $\pi_{t-1}$ and an initial guess for $\tilde Y_t$ (you can use $\tilde Y_{t-1}$ as the initial guess), use the monetary policy rule to solve for $R_t$.

- **Solve for $\tilde Y_t$ using the IS Curve**:
  With $R_t$ known, use the IS curve to solve for the new $\tilde Y_t$.

- **Update $\pi_t$ using the Phillips Curve**:
  Now, use the Phillips curve and the newly calculated $\tilde Y_t$ to update $\pi_t$.

### Step 5: Store and Repeat
After calculating $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ for the current period, store these values in your arrays/lists and move on to the next period ($t+1$), using the values from the current period as the "previous" period values for your next iteration.

### Step 6: Handling Shocks
If there are any exogenous shocks ($\bar o_t$) in a particular period, factor these into your calculations as you go. This typically affects the Phillips curve directly.

### Step 7: Analysis and Visualization
After completing the iterations, analyze the stored $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ values. You may want to visualize these using plots to understand the dynamics over time and the impact of any shocks.

### Example Implementation in Python (Pseudocode)
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Initial conditions and parameters
Y_prev = 0  # Initial output gap
pi_prev = 0  # Initial inflation
T = 100  # Number of periods
a_bar, b_bar, r_bar, psi, phi, pi_bar, nu_bar = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0.5)  # Example parameters
o_t = np.zeros(T)  # Shock to inflation, assume zero for simplicity

# Step 2: Time array (implicit in for loop)

# Step 3: Initialize arrays
Y_t = np.zeros(T)
pi_t = np.zeros(T)

# Step 4: Iterative calculation
for t in range(T):
    # Assuming shocks are reflected in o_t[t]
    R_t = r_bar + psi * (pi_prev - pi_bar) + phi * Y_prev  # MPR adjusted
    Y_t[t] = a_bar - b_bar * (R_t - r_bar)  # IS Curve
    pi_t[t] = pi_prev + nu_bar * Y_t[t] + o_t[t]  # Phillips Curve

    # Update for next iteration
    Y_prev = Y_t[t]
    pi_prev = pi_t[t]

# Step 7: Visualization
plt.plot(Y_t, label='Output Gap')
plt.plot(pi_t, label='Inflation')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This example is a basic representation. In practical applications, you may need to adjust it based on specific model requirements, additional constraints, or more complex dynamics, including more sophisticated handling of expectations and dynamic shocks.

## Question 2
You can't solve the three equations sequentially though, because the output gap $\tilde Y_t$ in the IS curve depends on the interest rate $R_t$ from the MPR (and vice versa), and the interest rate $R_t$ also depends on the inflation rate $\pi_t$ from the PC, which in turn depends on $\tilde Y_t$, and so on. I think you need to do some kind of iterative numerical method to reach the solution (because we effectively have two equations governing two unknowns, so there is guaranteed to be a unique solution). I'm just not sure what that method looks like.

## Answer 2
You're correct; the interdependence of the variables in the IS, MPR, and Phillips Curve (PC) equations requires a more sophisticated approach than sequential calculation. Since these equations are interrelated, solving them typically involves finding a simultaneous solution for the output gap ($\tilde Y_t$) and inflation rate ($\pi_t$) at each time step, given the dynamic nature of the system.

One common approach to solving such systems of equations is through an iterative numerical method like the Newton-Raphson method or a simpler fixed-point iteration method. However, given the dynamic nature of your model, with time-varying parameters and potential shocks, a straightforward application of these methods requires careful handling of the model's temporal aspect.

A simplified fixed-point iteration approach, adapted to this context, would involve iterating on the values of $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ until they converge to a stable solution for each time step before moving on to the next time step. This method might not be as fast or efficient as Newton-Raphson but is easier to implement and understand.

### Iterative Approach Overview

1. **Start with initial guesses** for $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ based on their values in the previous period or some other reasonable starting point.
2. **Iterate over the following steps** until both $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ converge to stable values for the time period you're calculating:
   - Use the Monetary Policy Rule (MPR) to compute a new estimate of the interest rate $R_t$ based on your current guesses for $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$.
   - With the newly estimated $R_t$, update your guess for $\tilde Y_t$ using the IS curve equation.
   - Then, update your guess for $\pi_t$ using the Phillips Curve (PC) with the newly updated $\tilde Y_t$.
3. **Check for convergence**. If the difference between the new and old values of both $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ is below a certain threshold, consider the solution for this time step as found. Otherwise, repeat step 2 with the updated values.
4. **Move to the next time period**, using the final values of $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ from the current time period as starting points (or parts of the starting points) for the next period.

### Implementation Sketch
This approach can be implemented in a programming language like Python. Here's a conceptual sketch (not complete code) to illustrate the idea:

```python
# Assuming you have defined the parameters and initial conditions

for t in range(T):  # Loop over each time period
    # Initial guess for Y_t and pi_t (could be from the previous timestep)
    Y_guess = Y_prev
    pi_guess = pi_prev

    while True:  # Iterative solution search
        # Compute R_t using the current guesses in the MPR
        R_t = r_bar + psi * (pi_guess - pi_bar) + phi * Y_guess

        # Update Y_t and pi_t using the IS curve and PC respectively
        Y_new = a_bar - b_bar * (R_t - r_bar)
        pi_new = pi_prev + nu_bar * Y_guess + o_t[t]  # Assuming o_t[t] is the shock at time t

        # Check for convergence
        if abs(Y_new - Y_guess) < tolerance and abs(pi_new - pi_guess) < tolerance:
            break  # Convergence achieved

        # Update guesses for the next iteration
        Y_guess, pi_guess = Y_new, pi_new

    # Store the converged values
    Y_t[t] = Y_new
    pi_t[t] = pi_new

    # Update Y_prev and pi_prev for the next timestep
    Y_prev, pi_prev = Y_t[t], pi_t[t]

# After the loop, Y_t and pi_t arrays contain the time series of your variables
```

### Notes
- **Convergence Criterion**: The `tolerance` variable is a small number (e.g., `1e-6`) that determines how close the new and old guesses need to be to consider the iteration to have converged.
- **Initial Guesses**: How you choose your initial guesses for each period can influence the speed of convergence. Using the final values from the previous period is a common and often effective strategy.
- **Complexity and Performance**: For more complex models or if performance is an issue, you might need to explore more sophisticated numerical methods or optimization libraries that can handle such iterative calculations more efficiently.

## Question 3
Given the pair of AS/AD coupled equations in discrete time
- AS: $\pi_t = \pi_{t-1} + \bar \nu \tilde Y_t + \bar o_t$
- AD: $\tilde Y_t = \frac{\bar a}{1+\phi \bar b } - \frac{\psi \bar b }{1+ \phi \bar b } (\pi_t - \bar \pi)$

a) How would you represent these using differential equations?
b) Using either the discrete or continuous time formulation (whichever is best), how would you solve for the evolution of these variables over time, perhaps using numerical methods or linear algebra.

## Answer 3

a) **Representing AS/AD Model Using Differential Equations**

The given equations are in discrete time. To represent them using differential equations for a continuous time formulation, we need to transition from discrete differences to derivatives. This involves replacing the discrete time changes (e.g., $\pi_t - \pi_{t-1}$) with derivatives (e.g., $\frac{d\pi}{dt}$). However, this translation requires some approximations since the original model is inherently discrete. A continuous representation might look like this:

- **AS (Aggregate Supply)**: The original discrete equation is $\pi_t = \pi_{t-1} + \bar \nu \tilde Y_t + \bar o_t$. A continuous approximation could be represented by the rate of change of inflation over time as influenced by the output gap and external shocks:
  $$\frac{d\pi}{dt} = \bar \nu \tilde Y + \bar o(t)$$
  Here, $\bar o(t)$ is a continuous function representing shocks over time.

- **AD (Aggregate Demand)**: The discrete equation is $\tilde Y_t = \frac{\bar a}{1+\phi \bar b } - \frac{\psi \bar b }{1+ \phi \bar b } (\pi_t - \bar \pi)$. In a continuous setting, assuming variables change smoothly over time, the relation remains essentially the same since it defines the output gap rather than its rate of change:
  $$\tilde Y = \frac{\bar a}{1+\phi \bar b } - \frac{\psi \bar b }{1+ \phi \bar b } (\pi - \bar \pi)$$

It's worth noting that converting a discrete-time model into a continuous one may not always capture the nuances of economic phenomena that are inherently discrete or occur at specific intervals (e.g., quarterly economic growth rates, annual inflation adjustments).

b) **Solving for the Evolution of Variables Over Time**

Given the choice between discrete and continuous formulations, using discrete time is more straightforward for numerical solutions, especially when dealing with economic data that are typically reported in discrete intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly). The discrete formulation directly lends itself to iterative numerical methods.

**Using the Discrete Formulation:**

1. **Initialization**: Start with initial values for $\pi_{t-1}$ and any known values for parameters ($\bar \nu, \bar a, \psi, \bar b, \phi, \bar \pi$) and shocks ($\bar o_t$).

2. **Iteration over Time Steps**: For each time step $t$ from the initial time to the end of the period you're interested in:

   a. Calculate $\tilde Y_t$ using the AD equation.

   b. Update $\pi_t$ using the new $\tilde Y_t$ in the AS equation.

3. **Repeat** the process for each time step. This approach allows you to simulate how $\pi_t$ and $\tilde Y_t$ evolve over time given the initial conditions and any external shocks represented by $\bar o_t$.

**Numerical Implementation** (e.g., in Python):

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters and initial conditions
a_bar, b_bar, nu_bar, psi, phi, pi_bar = (1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 0.3, 2)  # Example values
o_t = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 100)  # Example shocks
pi = [2]  # Initial inflation rate
Y = []  # Output gap

# Simulation over time
T = 100  # Number of time periods
for t in range(T):
    Y_t = (a_bar / (1 + phi * b_bar)) - (psi * b_bar / (1 + phi * b_bar)) * (pi[t] - pi_bar)
    Y.append(Y_t)
    if t < T - 1:  # Avoid adding to pi beyond the last time step
        pi_t = pi[t] + nu_bar * Y_t + o_t[t]
        pi.append(pi_t)

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(pi, label='Inflation Rate ($\\pi_t$)')
plt.plot(Y, label='Output Gap ($\\tilde Y_t$)')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Evolution of Inflation Rate and Output Gap Over Time')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This script initializes parameters and iterates over a given time period, updating the inflation rate and output gap based on the discrete-time AS/AD model equations. The example uses random shocks ($\bar o_t$) to demonstrate how external factors might influence these variables.

## Quesiton 4
No, the provided iterative numerical approach for the discrete formulation is incorrect. You cannot
 calculate the value of Y_t and pi separately, because they are linked by coupled equations (the value of pi affects Y *
*at that time** and vice versa). You need to solve the system of equations simultaneously at each time step. 

## Answer 4
You are correct, and I appreciate your patience. In the case of the AS/AD model with coupled equations, the interdependence of $\pi_t$ and $\tilde Y_t$ means that they must be solved simultaneously at each time step, as the calculation of one directly influences the other. This interdependence complicates the numerical solution, requiring a different approach than the one I initially described. Let's consider a more appropriate method for solving these coupled equations iteratively.

Given:
- AS: $\pi_t = \pi_{t-1} + \bar \nu \tilde Y_t + \bar o_t$
- AD: $\tilde Y_t = \frac{\bar a}{1+\phi \bar b } - \frac{\psi \bar b }{1+ \phi \bar b } (\pi_t - \bar \pi)$

These equations need to be solved together at each time step. One way to address this is by using a simultaneous equation solving method at each time step. Here is a revised approach:

### Step 1: Initialization
Start with an initial value for $\pi_{t-1}$ and any known parameters ($\bar a, \bar b, \bar \nu, \psi, \phi, \bar \pi$) and shocks ($\bar o_t$). You might also need an initial guess for $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ if solving simultaneously.

### Step 2: Iterative Solution for Each Time Step
For each time step $t$:
1. **Guess an initial value for $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$** (if starting from $t=0$, you can use the initial conditions; for subsequent $t$, the previous values of $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ can serve as initial guesses).
2. Use a numerical solver that can handle simultaneous equations to find the values of $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ that satisfy both the AS and AD equations. This might involve, for example, setting up a system of equations based on the AS and AD formulas and then applying a numerical method like Newton's method for multidimensional systems.

### Step 3: Update and Repeat
After solving for $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$, update their values for the next time iteration. Repeat the process for each time step.

### Example Approach Using Python (Pseudocode)

This example uses a simple iterative method to adjust $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$ until both the AS and AD equations are satisfied to a reasonable degree of accuracy. For a more sophisticated or efficient approach, you might consider using specific numerical solvers or optimization libraries available in Python, such as those in `scipy.optimize`.

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
a_bar, b_bar, nu_bar, psi, phi, pi_bar = 1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 0.3, 2
o_t = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 100)  # Example shocks
pi = [2]  # Initial pi value

# Function to calculate Y_t based on pi_t
def calc_Yt(pi_t, a_bar, b_bar, psi, phi, pi_bar):
    return (a_bar / (1 + phi * b_bar)) - (psi * b_bar / (1 + phi * b_bar)) * (pi_t - pi_bar)

# Function to calculate pi_t based on Y_t and previous pi value
def calc_pi_t(pi_prev, nu_bar, Y_t, o_t):
    return pi_prev + nu_bar * Y_t + o_t

# Iteration over time
for t in range(1, 100):  # Assuming 100 time periods
    # Initial guess for pi_t could be the last period's pi_t
    pi_guess = pi[-1]
    Y_t = calc_Yt(pi_guess, a_bar, b_bar, psi, phi, pi_bar)
    pi_t = calc_pi_t(pi[-1], nu_bar, Y_t, o_t[t])

    # Might need to iterate on pi_t and Y_t here if more accuracy is needed

    pi.append(pi_t)

# Now, pi contains the evolution of the inflation rate over time
```

This pseudocode outlines a basic iterative approach. Depending on the specifics of your model, especially if the equations are highly sensitive to initial conditions or if there's significant feedback between $\tilde Y_t$ and $\pi_t$, you might need a more sophisticated iteration scheme or numerical solver that better handles the coupling between these variables.

For more accurate and complex models, consider using solvers like those in `scipy.optimize`, which can handle coupled equations more efficiently and with better convergence properties.


## Question 5
What specific solvers might I consider using and how?

## Answer 5
For solving coupled equations like the ones in your AS/AD model, you can consider using numerical solvers from libraries such as `scipy.optimize` in Python. These solvers are designed to handle systems of equations, optimization problems, and even equations with complex interdependencies. Here, I'll introduce a couple of relevant solvers and a brief guide on how to use them for your problem:

### 1. `fsolve` from `scipy.optimize`

The `fsolve` function is a general-purpose solver for systems of nonlinear equations. It finds the roots of a function, meaning it solves for where the function equals zero. For your coupled equations, you would define a function that returns the discrepancies from both your AS and AD equations and use `fsolve` to find the values of $\pi_t$ and $\tilde Y_t$ that minimize these discrepancies.

#### Example Usage:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

# Parameters
a_bar, b_bar, nu_bar, psi, phi, pi_bar = 1, 2, 0.5, 1.5, 0.3, 2
o_t = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 100)  # Example shocks

# Initial conditions
pi_prev = 2  # Initial value for pi

# Define the system of equations
def equations(vars, pi_prev, o_t, a_bar, b_bar, nu_bar, psi, phi, pi_bar):
    pi_t, Y_t = vars
    eq1 = pi_t - (pi_prev + nu_bar * Y_t + o_t)
    eq2 = Y_t - ((a_bar / (1 + phi * b_bar)) - (psi * b_bar / (1 + phi * b_bar)) * (pi_t - pi_bar))
    return [eq1, eq2]

# Solve over time
pi = [pi_prev]  # To store the solution
for t in range(1, 100):  # Assuming 100 time periods
    pi_prev = pi[-1]  # Update pi_prev for the current time step
    # Solve the system of equations
    pi_t, Y_t = fsolve(equations, [pi_prev, 0], args=(pi_prev, o_t[t], a_bar, b_bar, nu_bar, psi, phi, pi_bar))
    pi.append(pi_t)

# pi now contains the evolution of the inflation rate over time
```

### 2. `root` from `scipy.optimize`

The `root` function is similar to `fsolve` but offers more options in terms of algorithms and is more flexible. It is used to find the roots of a vector function. You can specify different solving methods, making it a versatile choice for complex problems.

#### Example Usage:

The usage will be quite similar to `fsolve`, but you can specify the method:

```python
from scipy.optimize import root

# Using the same equations function from the fsolve example

# Solve over time, with root
for t in range(1, 100):
    pi_prev = pi[-1]
    solution = root(equations, [pi_prev, 0], args=(pi_prev, o_t[t], a_bar, b_bar, nu_bar, psi, phi, pi_bar), method='hybr')  # Example with method 'hybr'
    pi_t, Y_t = solution.x  # Extract the solution
    pi.append(pi_t)
```

### Choosing a Method and Solving

- **Method Choice**: The choice between `fsolve` and `root` (and within `root`, the choice of method like 'hybr', 'lm', etc.) depends on the specifics of your problem, including the nature of the equations (linear vs. nonlinear), the size of the system, and any potential for singularities or other numerical issues.
- **Initial Guess**: For both methods, the initial guess (`[pi_prev, 0]` in the examples) is crucial and can affect convergence. You may need to experiment with different initial guesses or methods if you encounter convergence issues.
- **Handling Time-Varying Parameters**: In the loop, the solver is called for each time step, allowing for the inclusion of time-varying parameters or shocks (like `o_t[t]` in the example).

These solvers are powerful tools for dealing with complex systems of equations and can significantly simplify the process of finding numerical solutions to economic models like the AS/AD model.
